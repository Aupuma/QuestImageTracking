# Quest ArUco Marker Tracking

This repository enables **single and multi-marker detection and tracking** using OpenCV with the **Meta Quest 3/3S Passthrough Camera API**.  
It provides a robust solution for **augmented reality applications** on Quest devices, supporting both individual markers and multiple markers simultaneously.

For a demonstration, check out the following videos:
